			<h3>Reasons why I have chosen this project.</h3>
			<p>I have chosen this for my front-end web application project because I work for an insurance company that uses a software called Guidewire. The application we are using at the moment has many issues with the layout and performance of the page. I will be continuing with this project after studying and I will also be linking it to a database using PHP. I will also be looking at adding this to a server to test and see whether it meets the expectation.</p>
			<p>Another reason why I have chosen this task is because my plan in the future is to introduce insurance to countries that do not have it yet, one of them is the place I was born in, Kurdistan.</p>
			<p>Accidents in Kurdistan result in the person at fault having to pay the full amount in order to repair both vehicles. I want to find a solution to this problem because not everyone can afford repairing vehicles having to pay from their pocket. Once I have discussed this with those organisation who are willing to contribute towards this project, I will then introduce them to this web based application that can be easily used by anyone. In the future I will also be introducing different languages so that it can be used worldwide.</p>
